   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Elmo's documentation!
================================

Elmo is l.m.o, which is l10n.mozilla.org.

Elmo is an infrastructure of web apps that are intended to help the
l10n community. Presently, our tools, docs, sites, wikipages, etc.,
all live in a fairly disorganized, disparate world that we often ask
localizers to navigate to get stuff done.

This documentation is about the `elmo django application
<https://github.com/mozilla/elmo>`_ and how it works and why it works
like it works.

All code is available here: https://github.com/mozilla/elmo

The production is available here: https://l10n-stage-sj.mozilla.org/
